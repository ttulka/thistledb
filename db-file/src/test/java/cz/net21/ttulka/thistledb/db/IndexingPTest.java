He is best known as the 'father of the IBM System/360', having served as project manager for its development and later as manager of the Operating System/360 software project during its design phase. For this work he, Bob Evans, and Erich Bloch were awarded the National Medal of Technology in 1985. Earlier, he was an architect of the IBM Stretch and Harvest computers. At Chapel Hill, Dr. Brooks founded the Department of Computer Science and chaired it from 1964 through 1984. He has served on the National Science Board and the Defense Science Board. His current teaching and research is in computer architecture, molecular graphics, and virtual environments. To my surprise and delight, The Mythical Man-Month continues to be popular after 20 years. Over 250,000 copies are in print. People often ask which of the opinions and recommendations.";
